  <h3>Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Piotr and I'm a self-taught coder and an aspiring software developer.
    I'm interested in the impact disruptive technologies have on politics and organizations.
    My main tools of trade are the web dev stack and Python. I'm very interested in Machine Learning and Big Data analytics.

<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>
  On this blog I will share some of my thoughts regarding recent developments in tech and politics.
  I also want to use this blog to keep track of my learning progress.
