I've never *really* blogged before, but I can definitely see the benefits. It's a good way to summarize what you've learnt, polish your writing skills, and maybe help someone who struggled as you did.
As an aspiring coder without anyone mentoring me, I had to rely on such blogs, as well as on Stack Overflow and mere language documentation when encountering a problem. Fortunately, the Internet is full of helpful people and easily accessible resources.

I decided to go with Jekyll and githubpages, instead of Wordpress or Blogspot. Although these platforms have some powerful advantages, they are easy to operate and establish. Jekyll is a bit more challenging, but it gives limitless customization opportunity.
