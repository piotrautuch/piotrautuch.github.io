I've never *really* blogged before, but I can definitely see the benefits. It's a good way to summarize what you've learnt, polish your writing skills, and maybe help someone who struggled as you did.
As an aspiring coder without anyone mentoring me, I had to rely on such blogs, as well as on Stack Overflow and mere language documentation when encountering a problem. Fortunately, the Internet is full of helpful people and easily accessible resources.

I decided to go with Jekyll and githubpages, instead of Wordpress or Blogspot. Although these platforms have some powerful advantages, they are easy to operate and establish. Jekyll is a bit more challenging, but it gives limitless customization opportunity. It actually took me more than I thought to think of a climatic and aesthetically pleasing design, and then actually implement it (I hope I succeeded!).

There is still a few things to add to the blog.
1. Add pagination to make navigation easier.
2. Add categories, so related articles can be found quickly.
3. Custom 404 page with some neat effects.
4. Experiment with CSS to add some life to the page.

Hopefully I'll be able to keep track of what I've done and what I yet have to learn with this blog.
